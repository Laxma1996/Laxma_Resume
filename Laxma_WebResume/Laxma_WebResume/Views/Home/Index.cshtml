                    I worked as a .NET and AngularJS developer in a games team, where we were migrating the old web-based application into a new web application using AngularJS. My work involved adding new features to improve client usability. The application's purpose was to store various types of data related to games and provide it in different forms for analysis, such as charts, graphs, ratings, rankings, and comparisons between games.

                    I worked as a .NET developer for a Newsletter Application, which was a Windows service. This application involved processing newsletters received through emails and converting them into images and HTML files. The data from the emails and their processed details were stored in a database. Additionally, I worked on creating backend modules.
